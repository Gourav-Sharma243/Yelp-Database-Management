Users can sign up on a registration page, create a login with their credentials, and access a navigation page. Here, they choose between searching for businesses or users. Upon entering search criteria, a new window displays results in tables. Clicking on a business row allows users to provide reviews, while clicking on a user row enables them to make friends. This streamlined process ensures a seamless and interactive experience for users exploring business and user data.
